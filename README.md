# Introduction

### Why C

C is mostly used for writting OS. The first OS written in C was Unix(Linux is also written in C). Most high-level programming languages are written in C (PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby).

C language combines universality and portability across various computer architectures while retaining most of the control of the hardware provided by assembly language.

C is compiled language, it is small: a C statement usually translates to a few assembly instructions, while most additional functionality comes from library functions.

C is designed for portability, performance, and minimal resource usage, making it ideal for systems like operating systems and embedded systems. Its explicit coding style helps programmers understand what each line does. Known for its efficiency and low-level capabilities, C is the native language of UNIX, highly portable, stable, and widely used. It allows direct memory manipulation through constructs like pointers and arrays, giving programmers control over memory layout and dynamic allocation, though deallocation must be managed manually.
